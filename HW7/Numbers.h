This function adds two unsigned integer types, represented as strings, given a base to work in.

This function subtracts two unsigned integer types, represented as strings, given a base to work in.
The return format will be a difference, computed in whatever base is specified, with as few digits as possible,
i.e., "0010" would be returned as "10", etc. We require 2 <= base <= 10.

subtract("30", "108", 10); // Do not do this!
