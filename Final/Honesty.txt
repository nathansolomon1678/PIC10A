I, Nathan Solomon, have read and understood the UCLA Student Conduct Code outlined in section 102.01 here https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Co de#academicdis7

I have not committed academic dishonesty.

I assert, on my honor, that I have not received assistance of any kind from any other person while working on the test and that I have not used any non-permitted materials or technologies during the period of this evaluation.
